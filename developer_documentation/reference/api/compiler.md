# Compiler Module

The `lattice_lock.compiler` module is responsible for the Polyglot compilation and build process.

> [!NOTE]
> This module is currently under development or not present in the current codebase version. This page serves as a placeholder for future documentation.

## Overview

The compiler is designed to translate Lattice Lock definitions into executable code for various target languages and environments.

## Future API

Expected functionality includes:

-   `compile_schema(schema_path: str, target_lang: str) -> str`
-   `build_project(project_path: str) -> BuildResult`
