# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Lattice Lock in 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have [installed Lattice Lock](installation.md) and have your [API keys configured](docs/getting_started/configuration.md).

## Step 1: Initialize a New Project

Open your terminal and create a new project directory:

```bash
mkdir my-first-agent
cd my-first-agent
lattice-lock init
```

This command creates a basic project structure and a default `lattice.yaml` file.

## Step 2: Define Your Agent

Edit the `lattice.yaml` file to define a simple agent. For this example, we'll use the default configuration generated by `init`.

## Step 3: Run Validation

Validate your project configuration and agent definitions:

```bash
lattice-lock validate
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
✓ Configuration loaded
✓ Schema validation passed
✓ Agent definitions valid

Project 'my-first-agent' is valid!
```

## Step 4: Run Your First Prompt

(Note: This assumes you have an API key set for a supported model provider).

```bash
lattice-lock orchestrator route "Hello, world!"
```

You should see the model's response in your terminal. The orchestrator will automatically select the best available model based on your configured API keys.

## Next Steps

- Learn about [Advanced Configuration](docs/getting_started/configuration.md)
- Check out the [API Reference](api_index.md)
