# .gitignore Documentation

This document provides a human-readable explanation of the `.gitignore` file used in the Lattice Lock Framework project. The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and directories should not be tracked in version control.

## Overview

The Lattice Lock Framework's `.gitignore` is organized into clearly labeled sections, each targeting a specific category of files that should be excluded from the repository. This helps keep the repository clean, secure, and focused on source code rather than generated artifacts, secrets, or environment-specific files.

## Section-by-Section Explanation

### Credentials and Secrets (Critical - Never Commit)

This is the most important section of the `.gitignore` file. It prevents sensitive information from being accidentally committed to the repository.

**What's Ignored:**
- `credentials/` - Directory that may contain credential files
- `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `*.jks`, `*.keystore` - Certificate and key files used for encryption, SSL/TLS, and authentication
- `*_rsa`, `*_rsa.pub`, `*_dsa`, `*_dsa.pub`, `*_ecdsa`, `*_ecdsa.pub`, `*_ed25519`, `*_ed25519.pub` - SSH key pairs (both private and public keys)
- `.env`, `.env.*` (except `.env.example`) - Environment variable files that often contain API keys, database passwords, and other secrets
- `*.secret`, `secrets.yaml`, `secrets.json`, `api_keys.txt` - Files explicitly named to contain secrets
- `*keychain*.txt`, `*security-report*.txt` - Keychain exports and security audit reports
- `.aws/credentials`, `.aws/config` - AWS credential files

**Why These Are Ignored:** Committing credentials to a repository is a serious security risk. Even if removed later, credentials remain in Git history and can be extracted. This section ensures that common credential file patterns are never tracked.

### Python

This section excludes Python-specific files that are generated during development and execution.

**What's Ignored:**
- `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `*$py.class` - Python bytecode cache files created when Python code is executed
- `*.so`, `.Python` - Compiled Python extensions
- `build/`, `develop-eggs/`, `dist/`, `downloads/`, `eggs/`, `.eggs/`, `lib/`, `lib64/`, `parts/`, `sdist/`, `var/`, `wheels/`, `pip-wheel-metadata/`, `share/python-wheels/` - Package build and distribution directories
- `*.egg-info/`, `.installed.cfg`, `*.egg`, `MANIFEST` - Package metadata files
- `venv/`, `env/`, `ENV/`, `env.bak/`, `venv.bak/`, `.venv/` - Virtual environment directories

**Why These Are Ignored:** These files are generated automatically and can be recreated from source code. Including them would bloat the repository and cause merge conflicts.

### PyTest and Testing Tools

**What's Ignored:**
- `.pytest_cache/` - Pytest's cache directory for faster test reruns
- `.coverage`, `.coverage.*`, `htmlcov/` - Code coverage data and HTML reports
- `.tox/`, `.nox/` - Test automation tool directories

**Why These Are Ignored:** Test artifacts are generated fresh each time tests run and don't need to be shared between developers.

### Type Checking Tools

**What's Ignored:**
- `.mypy_cache/`, `.dmypy.json`, `dmypy.json` - MyPy type checker cache
- `.pyre/` - Pyre type checker directory

**Why These Are Ignored:** Type checker caches are machine-specific and regenerated automatically.

### IDEs and Editors

This section prevents IDE-specific configuration files from cluttering the repository.

**What's Ignored:**
- `.vscode/` - Visual Studio Code settings and extensions
- `.idea/` - JetBrains IDEs (PyCharm, IntelliJ) settings
- `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*~` - Vim/Emacs swap and backup files
- `.DS_Store`, `.AppleDouble`, `.LSOverride`, `._*` - macOS Finder metadata files
- `.obsidian/` - Obsidian note-taking app configuration
- `.trash/`, `.Trash/` - Trash directories

**Why These Are Ignored:** IDE settings are personal preferences and can vary between developers. Including them would cause unnecessary conflicts and force everyone to use the same IDE configuration.

**Note:** The `.obsidian/` directory is currently tracked in this repository despite being in the `.gitignore`. This appears to be an oversight that should be addressed (see Recommendations section).

### AI/LLM Specific

This section is unique to the Lattice Lock Framework and handles AI-related artifacts.

**What's Ignored:**
- `.claude-flow/metrics/` - Claude Flow metrics data (can be regenerated)
- `model_cache/` - Cached AI model files
- `*.gguf.tmp`, `*.gguf.part` - Partial downloads of GGUF model files

**Why These Are Ignored:** AI model files are large and can be downloaded as needed. Metrics are generated during runtime and don't need to be version controlled.

### Logs and Temporary Files

**What's Ignored:**
- `*.log`, `logs/` - Log files and directories
- `*.tmp`, `*.temp`, `tmp/`, `temp/` - Temporary files and directories

**Why These Are Ignored:** Logs and temporary files are runtime artifacts that change frequently and don't represent source code.

### Database

**What's Ignored:**
- `*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3` - SQLite database files
- `*.db-shm`, `*.db-wal` - SQLite write-ahead log files

**Why These Are Ignored:** Database files contain data that may be sensitive or environment-specific. They should be created fresh or restored from backups.

### Compiled and Generated Files

**What's Ignored:**
- `*.pyc`, `*.pyo` - Python compiled files
- `*.class` - Java compiled files
- `*.o`, `*.obj` - C/C++ object files
- `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.dylib` - Executable and library files

**Why These Are Ignored:** Compiled files can be regenerated from source code and are platform-specific.

### OS Specific

**What's Ignored:**
- **macOS:** `.DS_Store`, `.AppleDouble`, `.LSOverride`, `Icon`, `.Spotlight-V100`, `.Trashes`
- **Windows:** `Thumbs.db`, `ehthumbs.db`, `Desktop.ini`
- **Linux:** `.directory`, `.Trash-*`

**Why These Are Ignored:** Operating system metadata files are not relevant to the project and vary between developers' machines.

### Project Specific

**What's Ignored:**
- `test_outputs/`, `coverage_reports/` - Test output directories
- `*.bak`, `*.backup`, `*~` - Backup files
- `.github/instructions/snyk_rules.instructions.md`, `snyk` - Snyk security extension auto-generated files

**Why These Are Ignored:** These are project-specific artifacts that are either generated or temporary.

## Patterns Explained

The `.gitignore` file uses several pattern types:

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `*.ext` | Matches any file with the extension | `*.log` matches `app.log`, `error.log` |
| `dir/` | Matches a directory and its contents | `build/` ignores the entire build directory |
| `!pattern` | Negates a previous pattern (exception) | `!.env.example` tracks `.env.example` despite `.env.*` |
| `**/pattern` | Matches in any directory | `**/*.pyc` matches `.pyc` files anywhere |
| `pattern*` | Matches files starting with pattern | `*_rsa` matches `id_rsa`, `deploy_rsa` |

## Recommendations

Based on analysis of the current repository state, the following additions or changes are recommended:

### Files That Should Be Added to .gitignore

1. **Consider adding:** `*.orig` - Git merge conflict backup files
2. **Consider adding:** `.hypothesis/` - Hypothesis testing framework cache (if property-based testing is used)

### Files Currently Tracked That May Need Review

1. **`.obsidian/` directory** - This directory is listed in `.gitignore` but appears to be tracked in the repository. This is likely because the files were committed before the `.gitignore` entry was added. To stop tracking:
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached .obsidian/
   git commit -m "chore: stop tracking .obsidian directory"
   ```

2. **`Untitled.md`** - This appears to be an outdated copy of the project tracker and may be a candidate for removal.

### Best Practices

1. **Never commit secrets** - Always use environment variables or secret management tools
2. **Use `.env.example`** - Provide a template for environment variables without actual values
3. **Review before committing** - Use `git status` and `git diff` to verify what's being committed
4. **Global gitignore** - Consider setting up a global `.gitignore` for OS-specific files
