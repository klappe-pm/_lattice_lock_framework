A comprehensive governance and validation framework for software projects that keeps humans and AI agents in perfect sync.

## 🚀 Overview

Lattice Lock is a **governance-first framework** designed to enforce code quality, architecture rules, and validation policies across your codebase. It bridges the gap between static analysis and runtime testing, ensuring your project adheres to its define structure ("The Lattice").

### Key Features

*   **🛡️ Sheriff:** AST-based static analysis to catch architecture violations in milliseconds.
*   **🥊 Gauntlet:** Runtime test generator that creates pytest suites from your governance rules.
*   **🤖 Orchestrator:** Intelligent multi-model routing for AI agents (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI).
*   **⚖️ Consensus:** Multi-model voting engine for high-stakes decision making.
*   **📜 Lattice Policy:** Declarative `lattice.yaml` configuration for all project rules.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install lattice-lock
```

### 1. Initialize a Project

```bash
lattice-lock init
# Creates a default lattice.yaml and project structure
```

### 2. Define Rules (`lattice.yaml`)

```yaml
version: "2.1"
rules:
  - id: "no-print"
    description: "Use logger instead of print"
    severity: "error"
    forbids: "node.is_call_to('print')"
```

### 3. Validate Code

```bash
# Run static analysis
lattice-lock validate
```

### 4. Ask the Orchestrator

```bash
# ask a question using the configured models
lattice-lock ask "Explain the architecture of this project"
```
