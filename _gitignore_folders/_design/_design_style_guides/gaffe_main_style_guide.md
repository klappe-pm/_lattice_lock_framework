# GAFFE.ai Content Style Guide

**An Authoritative Repository of the Great Agentic Future For Everyone**

---

## Our Core Philosophy

We laugh *with* the future, not *at* it.

GAFFE exists because we believe agentic AI will genuinely transform how people work, create, and live. That belief is exactly why we refuse to let the hype merchants, the vaporware peddlers, and the breathless LinkedIn posters define the conversation. The technology deserves better than its marketing.

Our satire is an act of care. We make fun of the nonsense precisely because we want the real thing to succeed.

## Voice & Tone

### Who We Are

We are the friend who works in tech, finds it genuinely exciting, but also can't help texting you screenshots of absurd product announcements with "lmao" and nothing else. We read the papers. We've tried the tools. We're building with this stuff. And we think the emperor's new clothes are hilarious—but we also think the emperor has some actually nice clothes in the closet if he'd just wear those instead.

### The GAFFE Voice

**Warm, not cynical.** We're at the party, not outside judging it. Our humor comes from familiarity and affection, not contempt.

**Smart, not smug.** We've done our homework. We understand the technology well enough to know what's real and what's theater. But we don't lord this over readers—we bring them along.

**Playful, not cruel.** We satirize ideas, announcements, and trends. We don't mock individuals (with rare exceptions for public figures who've made themselves the story). The junior PM who had to write that overwrought launch blog post isn't our target. The culture that demanded it is.

**Midwestern, not coastal.** More bemused head-shake than eye-roll. More "well, that's something" than "these idiots." We're fundamentally rooting for people to figure this out.

### Tone Calibration by Content Type

| Content Type | Humor Level | Sincerity Level |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Headlines | High (the hook) | Low |
| Opening section | Medium-high | Low-medium |
| Middle section | Medium | Medium |
| Commentary section | Low-medium | High |
| Closing section | Light callback | High |

## Content Structure: The GAFFE Arc

Every piece follows a three-act structure we call **Laugh → Think → See**.

### Act I: Laugh (The Setup)

Open with the absurdity. This is where we earn attention through humor.

- Lead with the joke, the observation, the "can you believe this" moment
- Use satirical headlines, mock announcements, or exaggerated-but-recognizable scenarios
- The humor should be specific enough to be funny, universal enough to land for non-experts
- Length: 20-30% of piece

**Example opening:**

> BREAKING: Series B Startup Announces "Agentic" Version of Product That Already Existed
>
> In a move analysts are calling "inevitable," productivity startup FlowSync today announced FlowSync Agent, which the company describes as "a paradigm shift in autonomous workflow orchestration." The new product automatically performs the same four integrations the old product performed, but now there's a chat interface and the word "autonomous" appears eleven times on the landing page.

### Act II: Think (The Turn)

Pivot from humor to insight. This is where we reward readers for sticking around.

- Unpack why the thing we're satirizing exists
- Acknowledge the legitimate impulse or problem underneath the hype
- Introduce complexity, nuance, real stakes
- This section can include actual reporting, data, or technical explanation
- Length: 40-50% of piece

**Example transition:**

> Here's the thing, though: FlowSync isn't wrong that something has changed.
>
> The tools we have today genuinely can do more than last year's tools. The gap between "chatbot that answers questions" and "system that takes actions on your behalf" is real, and it matters. The problem isn't that companies are excited about this. The problem is that we've built an entire communication infrastructure—press releases, launch posts, demo videos—that's incapable of saying "this is a meaningful incremental improvement."
>
> So everything becomes a revolution. And when everything's a revolution, nothing is.

### Act III: See (The Landing)

End with clarity about where we actually are—and genuine possibility about where we could go.

- Ground the reader in present reality: what works today, what doesn't, what's close
- Offer a clear-eyed but optimistic view of the trajectory
- Use aspirational but concrete language (not "will transform everything" but "could mean that...")
- Leave readers feeling oriented, not just entertained
- Length: 20-30% of piece

**Example closing:**

> Right now, in January 2025, here's what's true: agents can reliably handle well-defined, bounded tasks with clear success criteria. They're genuinely useful for things like research synthesis, code generation with human review, and structured data processing. They're not yet reliable for open-ended judgment calls, multi-step processes with ambiguous goals, or anything where failure is expensive.
>
> That's not a disappointment. That's a foundation. The companies doing honest work in this space are building the trust infrastructure—the evaluation frameworks, the human-in-loop patterns, the graceful failure modes—that will let agents take on more over time.
>
> The agentic future is coming. It's just arriving like all technology arrives: gradually, unevenly, and with a lot of bad marketing along the way.

## Language Guidelines

### Words We Use

- **Clear, concrete language** for technical concepts (explain like you're talking to a smart friend in a different field)
- **"Works" / "doesn't work yet" / "sometimes works"** — honest capability assessments
- **"Interesting" / "promising" / "early"** — when something has potential but isn't proven
- **"Currently" / "right now" / "as of today"** — temporal grounding
- **"Could mean" / "might enable" / "opens the possibility"** — aspirational without promising

### Words We Avoid

- **"Revolutionary" / "transformative" / "paradigm shift"** — unless we're satirizing them
- **"Just" (dismissive)** — as in "it's just a wrapper around GPT"—this diminishes real work
- **"Obviously"** — condescending to readers
- **"Game-changer"** — dead on arrival
- **"The future is here"** — the future is always arriving; this means nothing
- **Unexplained jargon** — if we use "RAG" or "function calling," we explain it or link out

### Headlines

Headlines should be funny first, accurate second. They're the hook.

**Good headlines:**
- "Startup Achieves Full Autonomy (In Demo Environment With Pre-Loaded Data)"
- "Agent Successfully Completes Task After Only Four Human Interventions"
- "New Study Finds 80% of 'Agents' Are Actually 'Programs'"
- "Area Man's Autonomous Agent Autonomously Asks Him What To Do Next"

**Bad headlines:**
- "Why Agents Are Overhyped" (too obvious, no joke)
- "The Problem With AI" (too broad, not our beat)
- "This Startup Is Lying" (mean, potentially libelous, not funny)

## Visual Style

### Overall Aesthetic

**Clean, professional, slightly formal**—the joke is that we look like a legitimate industry publication. Think Bloomberg or The Information, but the content is satirical. The visual restraint makes the humor land harder.

### Color Palette

| Use | Color | Hex |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Primary text | Near-black | #1a1a1a |
| Background | Off-white | #fafafa |
| Accent (links, highlights) | Muted blue | #2563eb |
| Secondary accent (sparingly) | Warm gray | #6b7280 |

No gradients. No neon. No "tech startup" purple-to-blue swooshes.

### Typography

- **Headlines:** Serif font (Georgia, Spectral, or similar) — connotes authority, plays against expectations for a "tech" site
- **Body:** Clean sans-serif (Inter, System UI) — readable, neutral
- **Monospace for "quoted" fake announcements or press releases** — signals "this is a document we're examining"

### Imagery

**What we use:**
- Simple iconography (minimal, one-color)
- Fake "product screenshots" that are clearly satirical
- Charts and graphs that visualize absurd claims
- Stock photography used deadpan (the "corporate" aesthetic is part of the joke)

**What we avoid:**
- Robot illustrations
- Glowing brains
- Hands shaking with AI
- Any visual cliché from AI marketing

### Charts & Data Visualization

When we create fake charts (e.g., "Agent Autonomy Levels by Marketing Copy vs. Reality"), they should be:
- Visually indistinguishable from real charts
- Clearly labeled as satirical in the caption
- Actually make a real point underneath the joke

## Content Categories

### The Dispatch

Short-form satirical news items. Quick hits. One joke, one insight.
- Length: 200-400 words
- Frequency: 2-3x per week
- Structure: Satirical lede → brief turn → one-line grounding

### The Analysis

Longer pieces following the full Laugh → Think → See arc.
- Length: 800-1500 words
- Frequency: 1x per week
- Structure: Full three-act treatment

### The Glossary

Ongoing satirical-but-useful definitions of agentic AI terms.
- Format: Term + straight definition + satirical "in practice" definition + honest assessment
- Example:

> **Autonomous Agent**
>
> *Official definition:* A software system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve goals without continuous human guidance.
>
> *In practice:* A chatbot with a for-loop and a Zapier integration.
>
> *Honest assessment:* True autonomy exists on a spectrum. The most capable current agents can handle multi-step tasks within narrow domains, but still require human oversight for edge cases and error recovery. The word "autonomous" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in most marketing materials.

### The Tracker

Periodic roundups of real developments, reported straight.
- No satire in this section—this is where we establish credibility
- Honest assessments of what shipped, what's vaporware, what's promising
- Think of it as the "earned trust" content that makes the satire land

---

## Editorial Standards

### Accuracy in Satire

- Satirical claims should be exaggerated versions of real patterns, not fabrications
- If we reference a real company or product, the underlying facts should be accurate even if the framing is humorous
- We don't invent quotes or attribute fake statements to real people

### Corrections

- If we get something wrong, we correct it clearly and promptly
- Corrections appear at the top of the piece, not buried
- Being wrong is a gaffe; not correcting it is a choice

### Conflicts of Interest

- If a writer has a financial interest in or professional relationship with a company mentioned, disclose it
- We don't do sponsored content, but if that ever changes, it will be clearly labeled

## Our Audience

### Primary Audience

**The curious professional.** They've heard "agents" thrown around in meetings. They've maybe tried ChatGPT or Copilot. They suspect some of what they're seeing is hype but don't have the technical background to evaluate it. They want to understand what's real without getting a CS degree. They appreciate humor that helps them feel less overwhelmed.

### Secondary Audience

**The insider who's tired.** They work in AI or adjacent fields. They know what's real and what's theater. They're exhausted by the hype but still believe in the technology. They want a place that reflects their experience back to them and reminds them why they got into this.

### Not Our Audience

**The true cynic.** If you think AI is entirely a scam, a bubble, or a net negative for humanity, you'll enjoy some of our jokes but find the earnest parts unsatisfying. That's okay. We're not trying to convert you.

**The true believer.** If any criticism of AI marketing feels like an attack on progress itself, we're probably not for you either.

---

## The GAFFE Credo

We believe:

1. Agentic AI is a real and significant technological development
2. The way we talk about it is often absurd
3. Humor is a legitimate tool for cutting through nonsense
4. Clarity serves everyone better than hype
5. Optimism and skepticism can coexist
6. The best future is one we build with open eyes

## Sample Content: Full Example

### Headline

**New Agent Startup Promises to "Automate Your Entire Business" (With 47 Asterisks)**

### Act I: Laugh

LaunchPad AI emerged from stealth today with $40 million in funding and a bold claim: their new product, AgentForce, can "automate your entire business, end to end."

The asterisks, which appear in 4-point font at the bottom of the announcement, clarify that "entire business" refers to "specific, pre-approved workflows," "end to end" means "with human review at each checkpoint," and "automate" is defined as "assist with."

"We're incredibly excited to bring true autonomy to the enterprise," said CEO Jennifer Martinez, reading from a script that was, somewhat ironically, written by a human. "This is the future of work."

The future of work, according to the demo video, appears to involve a lot of clicking "Approve" buttons.

### Act II: Think

Here's what's actually happening: LaunchPad has built what appears to be a reasonably competent workflow automation tool with an LLM layer on top. It can read emails, draft responses, and route tasks to the appropriate systems. Based on the technical documentation (buried several clicks deep on their site), it handles structured, predictable processes well and flags ambiguous cases for human review.

That's... genuinely useful. Workflow automation is a real market with real pain points. Adding natural language interfaces and better edge-case handling is legitimate progress.

But "automate your entire business" is a claim that means something. It creates expectations. When the actual product is "handle 60% of routine email processing with 90% accuracy," the gap between promise and reality breeds the exact cynicism that makes it harder for good tools to get adopted.

This isn't unique to LaunchPad. The entire sector has a communication problem. The incentives—VC expectations, press coverage, competitive positioning—all push toward maximalist claims. And the vocabulary we've developed for talking about AI capabilities is almost perfectly designed to obscure rather than clarify.

### Act III: See

Where are we actually? Here's a honest assessment of enterprise agents in early 2025:

**What works now:** Document processing, structured data extraction, research synthesis, first-draft generation, routine classification tasks. These are mature enough to deploy with appropriate human oversight.

**What's emerging:** Multi-step workflows with handoff points, context-aware routing, basic negotiation of simple processes. Real but requires careful scoping.

**What's still theater:** End-to-end business automation, fully autonomous decision-making, anything described as "set it and forget it."

The gap will close. The underlying technology is improving faster than most previous enterprise software categories. Companies that are doing the hard work of building reliable, trustworthy systems—even if their capabilities are narrower than their competitors' marketing—are laying groundwork that matters.

LaunchPad might be one of them. It's hard to tell from the announcement. That's the problem.
