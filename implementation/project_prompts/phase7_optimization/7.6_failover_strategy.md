# Task 7.6: Multi-Region Failover Strategy

**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** Gemini Antimatter
**Implementation Task:** (Devin AI)

---

## 1. Scenario
Primary LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI us-east-1) goes down.

## 2. Failover Logic
Extend `BedrockClient` (Task 6.1.4) to support regional failover.

```python
config = {
    "primary": {"provider": "bedrock", "region": "us-east-1"},
    "secondary": {"provider": "bedrock", "region": "us-west-2"},
    "tertiary": {"provider": "openai"}
}
```

## 3. Circuit Breakers
Implement "Circuit Breaker" pattern:
*   If > 5 errors in 1 minute, open circuit for Primary.
*   Route all traffic to Secondary for 5 minutes.
*   Half-open check after 5 mins.

## 4. State Sync
Cost tracking database must be eventually consistent or centralized (e.g., S3/DynamoDB instead of SQLite for multi-region).
